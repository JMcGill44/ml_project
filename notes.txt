Experiment 1 (feature addition/selection)

lm before - offset = 0.1, checkpoint 5 features (no differential & old list)
lm after - offset = 0.1, checkpoint 6 features (differential & new list)

rf before - old parameters, all stats (no seed, no differential)

rf after - old parameters, all stats (seed, differential)

Experiment 2 (Random forest parameters)

lm before - lm after from above ^
lm after - offset = special, checkpoint 6 features (differential & new list)

rf before - rf after from above ^

rf after - new parameters, all stats (seed, differential)
